# Frank-Wolfe-based-method-for-SD-MMV
We solve separable NMF problem under convex relaxation in the form of self-dictionary multiple measurement vectors (SD-MMV), using Frank-Wolfe algorithm. It possesses desirable identifiability properties even under noisy case while only requires a linear growth to data size in memory.
