Please run the file "Experiment_2by3_illcond.m" (resp. "Experiment_Middle_Points.m") to compare the different near-separable NMF algorithms on synthetic data sets, as done in Section 5.1 (resp. 5.2) of [1]. 

To run the experiments, you need the CVX toolbox of Matlab; see http://cvxr.com/cvx/. 

To run the second experiment, you need the Statistics toolbox of Matlab. 

Please report any bug to nicolas.gillis@umons.ac.be. Thanks!
